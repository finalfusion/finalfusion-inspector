# finalfusion inspector

## Introduction

finalfusion inspector is a small GUI tool to inspect
[finalfusion](https://finalfusion.github.io/) embeddings. It provides
the following functionality:

* Show embeddings metadata.
* Perform similarity queries.
* Perform analogy queries.
* For a given word, show the subwords for which there are embeddings.
* Visualize distances between sets of words in a 2D plot

The interface uses the Qt toolkit and thus should integrate well with
various platforms.
